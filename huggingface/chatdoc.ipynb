A public place.\\n\\n\\n Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nGregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nNo, for then we should be colliers.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nI mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nAy, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nI strike quickly, being moved.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nBut thou art not quickly moved to strike.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nA dog of the house of Montague moves me.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nTo move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou\\nart moved, thou runn’st away.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nA dog of that house shall move me to stand.\\nI will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nThat shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nTrue, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to\\nthe wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and\\nthrust his maids to the wall.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nThe quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\n’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the\\nmen I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nThe heads of the maids?\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nAy, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense\\nthou wilt.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nThey must take it in sense that feel it.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nMe they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am a\\npretty piece of flesh.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\n’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John.\\nDraw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.\\n\\n Enter Abram and Balthasar.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nMy naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nHow?

No, sir.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nBut if you do, sir, I am for you.

Gregory, remember thy washing blow.\\n\\n [_They fight._]\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nPart, fools! put up your swords, you know not what you do.\\n\\n [_Beats down their swords._]\\n\\n Enter Tybalt.\\n\\nTYBALT.\\nWhat, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?\\nTurn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nI do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,\\nOr manage it to part these men with me.\\n\\nTYBALT.\\nWhat, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word\\nAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:\\nHave at thee, coward.\\n\\n [_They fight._]\\n\\n Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN.\\nClubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!\\nDown with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!\\n\\n Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nWhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\\n\\nLADY CAPULET.\\nA crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nMy sword, I say! Old Montague is come,\\nAnd flourishes his blade in spite of me.\\n\\n Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nThou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go.\\n\\nLADY MONTAGUE.\\nThou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.\\n\\n Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nRebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\\nProfaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—\\nWill they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,\\nThat quench the fire of your pernicious rage\\nWith purple fountains issuing from your veins,\\nOn pain of torture, from those bloody hands\\nThrow your mistemper’d weapons to the ground\\nAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.\\nThree civil brawls, bred of an airy word,\\nBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\\nHave thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,\\nAnd made Verona’s ancient citizens\\nCast by their grave beseeming ornaments,\\nTo wield old partisans, in hands as old,\\nCanker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.\\nIf ever you disturb our streets again,\\nYour lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\\nFor this time all the rest depart away:\\nYou, Capulet, shall go along with me,\\nAnd Montague, come you this afternoon,\\nTo know our farther pleasure in this case,\\nTo old Free-town, our common judgement-place.\\nOnce more, on pain of death, all men depart.\\n\\n [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,\\n Citizens and Servants._]\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\\nSpeak, nephew, were you by when it began?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nHere were the servants of your adversary\\nAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\\nI drew to part them, in the instant came\\nThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,\\nWhich, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,\\nHe swung about his head, and cut the winds,\\nWho nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.\\nWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows\\nCame more and more, and fought on part and part,\\nTill the Prince came, who parted either part.\\n\\nLADY MONTAGUE.\\nO where is Romeo, saw you him today?\\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nMadam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun\\nPeer’d forth the golden window of the east,\\nA troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,\\nWhere underneath the grove of sycamore\\nThat westward rooteth from this city side,\\nSo early walking did I see your son.\\nTowards him I made, but he was ware of me,\\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood.\\nI, measuring his affections by my own,\\nWhich then most sought where most might not be found,\\nBeing one too many by my weary self,\\nPursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,\\nAnd gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,\\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\\nShould in the farthest east begin to draw\\nThe shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,\\nAway from light steals home my heavy son,\\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,\\nShuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out\\nAnd makes himself an artificial night.\\nBlack and portentous must this humour prove,\\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nI neither know it nor can learn of him.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nHave you importun’d him by any means?\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nBoth by myself and many other friends;\\nBut he, his own affections’ counsellor,\\nIs to himself—I will not say how true—\\nBut to himself so secret and so close,\\nSo far from sounding and discovery,\\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm\\nEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,\\nOr dedicate his beauty to the sun.\\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\\nWe would as willingly give cure as know.\\n\\n Enter Romeo.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nSee, where he comes. So please you step aside;\\nI’ll know his grievance or be much denied.\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay\\nTo hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,\\n\\n [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nGood morrow, cousin.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nIs the day so young?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nBut new struck nine.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAy me, sad hours seem long.\\nWas that my father that went hence so fast?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nIt was.

And is he a man to encounter\\nTybalt?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nWhy, what is Tybalt?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nMore than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of\\ncompliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,\\nand proportion. He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in\\nyour bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;\\na gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,\\nthe immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nThe what?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nThe pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners\\nof accent. By Jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good\\nwhore. Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should\\nbe thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,\\nthese pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot\\nsit at ease on the old bench? O their bones, their bones!\\n\\n Enter Romeo.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nHere comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nWithout his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou\\nfishified!

Now art thou\\nsociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as\\nwell as by nature.

But first\\nlet me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they\\nsay, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the\\ngentlewoman is young.

Did you ne’er hear say,\\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nWell, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a\\nlittle prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that\\nwould fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a\\ntoad, a very toad, as see him.

No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his\\nleg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though\\nthey be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare.

Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a\\nhair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel\\nwith a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou\\nhast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\\nThy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy\\nhead hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast\\nquarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath\\nwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall\\nout with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with\\nanother for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\\ntutor me from quarrelling!\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nAnd I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee\\nsimple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nThe fee simple!

Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a\\ngrave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both\\nyour houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to\\ndeath. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of\\narithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your\\narm.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI thought all for the best.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nHelp me into some house, Benvolio,\\nOr I shall faint.

All this uttered\\nWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d\\nCould not take truce with the unruly spleen\\nOf Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts\\nWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,\\nWho, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\\nAnd, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\\nCold death aside, and with the other sends\\nIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\\n‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,\\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points,\\nAnd ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\\nAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.\\nBut by and by comes back to Romeo,\\nWho had but newly entertain’d revenge,\\nAnd to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I\\nCould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;\\nAnd as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.\\nThis is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\\n\\nLADY CAPULET.\\nHe is a kinsman to the Montague.\\nAffection makes him false, he speaks not true.\\nSome twenty of them fought in this black strife,\\nAnd all those twenty could but kill one life.\\nI beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;\\nRomeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nRomeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.\\nWho now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nNot Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;\\nHis fault concludes but what the law should end,\\nThe life of Tybalt.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nAnd for that offence\\nImmediately we do exile him hence.\\nI have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,\\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.\\nBut I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine\\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.\\nI will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\\nTherefore use none.

Stay the Friar too.\\n\\n Enter the Prince and Attendants.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nWhat misadventure is so early up,\\nThat calls our person from our morning’s rest?\\n\\n Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and others.\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nWhat should it be that they so shriek abroad?\\n\\nLADY CAPULET.\\nO the people in the street cry Romeo,\\nSome Juliet, and some Paris, and all run\\nWith open outcry toward our monument.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nWhat fear is this which startles in our ears?\\n\\nFIRST WATCH.\\nSovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,\\nAnd Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,\\nWarm and new kill’d.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nSearch, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.\\n\\nFIRST WATCH.\\nHere is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man,\\nWith instruments upon them fit to open\\nThese dead men’s tombs.\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nO heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\\nThis dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house\\nIs empty on the back of Montague,\\nAnd it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom.\\n\\nLADY CAPULET.\\nO me! This sight of death is as a bell\\nThat warns my old age to a sepulchre.\\n\\n Enter Montague and others.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nCome, Montague, for thou art early up,\\nTo see thy son and heir more early down.\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nAlas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.\\nGrief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.\\nWhat further woe conspires against mine age?\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nLook, and thou shalt see.\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nO thou untaught! What manners is in this,\\nTo press before thy father to a grave?\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nSeal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\\nTill we can clear these ambiguities,\\nAnd know their spring, their head, their true descent,\\nAnd then will I be general of your woes,\\nAnd lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\\nAnd let mischance be slave to patience.\\nBring forth the parties of suspicion.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nI am the greatest, able to do least,\\nYet most suspected, as the time and place\\nDoth make against me, of this direful murder.\\nAnd here I stand, both to impeach and purge\\nMyself condemned and myself excus’d.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nThen say at once what thou dost know in this.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nI will be brief, for my short date of breath\\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale.\\nRomeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,\\nAnd she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.\\nI married them; and their stol’n marriage day\\nWas Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death\\nBanish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;\\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.\\nYou, to remove that siege of grief from her,\\nBetroth’d, and would have married her perforce\\nTo County Paris. Then comes she to me,\\nAnd with wild looks, bid me devise some means\\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\\nThen gave I her, so tutored by my art,\\nA sleeping potion, which so took effect\\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\\nThat he should hither come as this dire night\\nTo help to take her from her borrow’d grave,\\nBeing the time the potion’s force should cease.\\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\\nWas stay’d by accident; and yesternight\\nReturn’d my letter back. Then all alone\\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\\nCame I to take her from her kindred’s vault,\\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell\\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay\\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth\\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.\\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb;\\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me,\\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\\nAll this I know; and to the marriage\\nHer Nurse is privy. And if ought in this\\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\\nBe sacrific’d, some hour before his time,\\nUnto the rigour of severest law.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.\\nWhere’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nI brought my master news of Juliet’s death,\\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\\nAnd threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,\\nIf I departed not, and left him there.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nGive me the letter, I will look on it.\\nWhere is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?\\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\\n\\nPAGE.\\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,\\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb,\\nAnd by and by my master drew on him,\\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nThis letter doth make good the Friar’s words,\\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death.\\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\\nOf a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal\\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\\nWhere be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\\nAnd I, for winking at your discords too,\\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand.\\nThis is my daughter’s jointure, for no more\\nCan I demand.\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nBut I can give thee more,\\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold,\\nThat whiles Verona by that name is known,\\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nAs rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,\\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings;\\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things.\\nSome shall be pardon’d, and some punished,\\nFor never was a story of more woe\\nThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ROMEO AND JULIET ***\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n')]"
